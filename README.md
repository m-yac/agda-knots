# Agda Knots

An experimental formalization of Knot Theory in Agda, with specific attention paid to Legendrian Knot Theory.

## TODO

- Rework to remove inconvenient induction in `Isotopy.agda`
- Documentation, explanation, references throughout
- Proof that tb, etc. are actually invariant!
- Some of the Legendrian Knot Atlas as examples
- Independence of `standard-library`?
