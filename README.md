# Agda Knots

An experimental formalization of Knot Theory in Agda, with specific attention paid to Legendrian Knot Theory.

## TODO

- `IsoReasoning` in the style of stdlib's `â‰¡-Reasoning`, from `_below_btwn_,_`
- Definitions (in terms of stabilizations, etc.) of (some?) remaining *smooth* Reidemeister moves
- Good tools for proving invariance (spec. for `DependentMonoid+`s!)
- Proof that tb, etc. are actually invariant
- Documentation, explanation, references throughout
- Some of the Legendrian Knot Atlas as examples
- Independence of `standard-library`?
